# Ohjaaja.bc.fi
A client project for Ohjaaja.bc.fi site which is made with Wordpress. Site was executed in a group of three developer students. My responsibility was to built Ty√∂paikkaohjaaja and Osaamisen arviointi pages. I designed the layout according to the graphic guidelines of the company and the content provided.   This was my first client project and it was interesting to build a web site for a real client and work with the various parties involved in the project. I also learned a lot of a project management in a development project. We used tools like Trello and WinSCP in our project.   An interesting part of the project was to provide the client with guidance on how to maintain the site. For this we used the Dreambroker tool to shoot and record instructional videos on the various features that the client would need for maintenance.
